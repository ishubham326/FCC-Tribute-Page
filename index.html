        <p id="tribute-info">With amazing spider-like abilities, science whiz Peter Parker fights crime daily, but when the mask is off, he goes through a simple life like one of us. Struggling to make ends meet, but always finding happiness in the little things. After losing his parents at an early age, Peter Parker went on to live with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. During a field trip to Osborn Industries, Peter was bit by a radioactive spider, which led to him acquiring powers such as proportional strength of a spider, being able to stick to walls and other surfaces, as well as spider-sense which alerts him of any nearby danger. Peter went on to invent his webbing and decided to use his powers for the better and to fight off crime after his Uncle was murdered by a random cat burglar Peter decided to let him run free.
